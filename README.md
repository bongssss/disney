# Description
Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has released more than 600 films covering a wide range of genres. While some movies
are indeed directed towards kids, many are intended for a broad audience. In this project, we will analyze data to see how
Disney movies have changed in popularity since its first movie release. This project explores how we can use some
datamining techniques to retrieve data that we need from a dataset of Disney movies from their very first movie release till
now and use them to answer some certain questions.
